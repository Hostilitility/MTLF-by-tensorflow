# MTLF
MTLF algorithm for regression implemented on tensorflow, written by Yu Ye


The algorithm was proposed by:

Xu Y, Pan S J, Xiong H, et al. A unified framework for metric transfer learning[J].
IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 2017, 29(6): 1158-1171.
    
    
Only the classification version of MTLF on Matlab is given by the author. So we implement 
the algorithm on tensorflow, and replace SGD, the default optimization algorithm, with Adam.
